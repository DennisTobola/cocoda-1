A **registry** is an individual source of data about [concept schemes](#concept-schemes), [concepts](#concepts), [mappings](#mappings) etc. An example is the public [concordance registry](http://coli-conc.gbv.de/concordances/) with concordances and mappings collected in project coli-conc.

Registries can be configured via the `registries` field in the [configuration](#configuration). The technical access to data from a registry is implemented via [providers](#providers).

Configured mapping registries can be enabled and disabled in the mapping browser to show or hide their mappings.
