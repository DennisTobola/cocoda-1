Individual knowledge organization systems are referred to as **concept schmes** or just **schemes**. Concept schemes are also known as ontologies, (controlled) vocabularies, taxonomies, and terminologies. Cocoda provides access to multiple concept schemes from multiple sources.

A concept scheme is an organized collection of [concepts](#concepts) and additional information about the concept scheme.  Cocoda recommends all concept schemes to be registered in the [Basel Register of Thesauri, Ontologies & Classifications (BARTOC)](https://BARTOC.org) and to use its identifiers for to uniquely refer to indivial concept schemes.

To give an example the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) is a concept scheme of type universal library classification, published by OCLC and registered in BARTOC with URI <http://bartoc.org/en/node/241>.
