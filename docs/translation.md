The Cocoda interface is currently available in English and German. To make contributions to these translations easier, we have developed a small tool. By opening [this page](https://gbv.github.io/cocoda-locale-editor/?fromUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fgbv%2Fcocoda%2Fdev%2Fconfig%2Flocale.json), you can contribute by editing existing texts or adding a new language:

- Add a new language in the "New language" section right above the table. This language will be added as a new column in the table.
- Use the text fields in the table to edit the texts. Each row represents a single piece of text in the interface.
- The "New path" function below the table is only necessary if new text pieces need to be added (i.e. when you're directly involved in the development or if you want to suggest a feature and provide the necessary text in advance).
- After you are finished, you can download the `locale.json` file with the "Download" button at the top. You can either send this file to [coli-conc@gbv.de](mailto:coli-conc@gbv.de), upload the file to a server and post the link as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/gbv/cocoda/issues/new), or create a [pull request](https://github.com/gbv/cocoda/pull/new/dev) and commit the file there.
- Note that the edits in the tool will be lost if you reload the site! To make sure that your edits won't be lost, use the "Download" button regularly and reupload the file if necessary.
